# Jetbrains Version Control

A faithful recreation ofJetBrains' commit side panel, made for Visual Studio Code.

THIS EXTENSION IS WORK IN PROGRESS! IF YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES/FEATURE REQUESTS PLEASE LET ME KNOW!
I created this because I liked the fast and convenient way to quickly check and commit individiual files in Jetbrains IDEs.
Best used with my Clion Dark Perfected theme!
